Hi! My name is Gabriel and I am a second year PhD student in Statistics at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jiashun Jin](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~jiashun/). I am mainly interested in developping new statistical and machine learning methods for complex data such as texts and shapes. Prior starting my PhD, I received a Master from the Ecole Normale Supérieure and a Master from the University of Oxford advised by [Prof. Ulrike Tillmann](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/tillmann/), [Prof. Heather Harrington](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/heather.harrington), and [Prof. Agnese Barbensi](https://sites.google.com/view/agnesebarbensi/home) where I was interested in studying how persistent homology could be used to help understand knotted proteins. I am always interested in collaborating on new projects so feel free to reach out if you are interested in similar research topics.
