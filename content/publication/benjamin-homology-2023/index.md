abstract: Quantification and classification of protein structures, such as knotted
  proteins, often requires noise-free and complete data. Here, we develop a mathematical
  pipeline that systematically analyses protein structures. We showcase this geometric
  framework on proteins forming open-ended trefoil knots, and we demonstrate that
  the mathematical tool, persistent homology, faithfully represents their structural
  homology. This topological pipeline identifies important geometric features of protein
  entanglement and clusters the space of trefoil proteins according to their depth.
  Persistence landscapes quantify the topological difference between a family of knotted
  and unknotted proteins in the same structural homology class. This difference is
  localized and interpreted geometrically with recent advancements in systematic computation
  of homology generators. The topological and geometric quantification we find is
  robust to noisy input data, which demonstrates the potential of this approach in
  contexts where standard knot theoretic tools fail.
