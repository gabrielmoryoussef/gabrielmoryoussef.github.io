	abstract = {Quantification and classification of protein structures, such as knotted proteins, often requires noise-free and complete data. Here, we develop a mathematical pipeline that systematically analyses protein structures. We showcase this geometric framework on proteins forming open-ended trefoil knots, and we demonstrate that the mathematical tool, persistent homology, faithfully represents their structural homology. This topological pipeline identifies important geometric features of protein entanglement and clusters the space of trefoil proteins according to their depth. Persistence landscapes quantify the topological difference between a family of knotted and unknotted proteins in the same structural homology class. This difference is localized and interpreted geometrically with recent advancements in systematic computation of homology generators. The topological and geometric quantification we find is robust to noisy input data, which demonstrates the potential of this approach in contexts where standard knot theoretic tools fail.},
